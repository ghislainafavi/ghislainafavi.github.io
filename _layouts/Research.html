    <p> Can a Two-Agent New Keynesian model, also known as TANK, approximate a Heterogeneous Agents New Keynesian (HANK) model in terms of its aggregate response to a monetary policy shock? In this paper, I show that the answer depends on the source of nominal rigidities. If prices are sticky, the answer is yes, as shown by Debortoli and Gali (2018). If wages are sticky, the answer is no, as shown in this paper. To make this point, I show that the TANK model with only wage rigidities is equivalent, in terms of aggregate variables, to the representative agent New Keynesian model. For TANK with both price and wage rigidities, I show numerically that TANK does not approximate HANK well.  </p>

       <p>This paper studies the  role of household heterogeneity for the severity of  financial crisis and its implication for prudential capital control policy. I use data on sudden stops events and on financial market participation to document that a lower financial market participation is associated with a higher drop in asset prices. To explain the role of financial market participation in the  drop of asset prices, I  build an equilibrium business cycle model with a collateral constraint, and with limited financial market participation.  The heterogeneity in the  accessibility  to the financial market generates income and consumption inequality in the model. The extent to which the limited financial market participation amplifies the drop in asset prices depends on the cyclicality of consumption inequality. Consistent with my empirical finding using a household survey data from Mexico, the model generates a drop in consumption inequality during the financial crisis which amplifies the drops in asset prices, output, and consumption.  I also show that the optimal time-consistent debt tax  should be higher in a limited financial market participation,   economy, which rationalize the use of capital control in emerging markets.  Finally my findings suggest it is possible to address financial instability without raising inequality.    </p>
