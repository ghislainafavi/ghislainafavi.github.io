    <p> Can a Two-Agent New Keynesian model, also known as TANK, approximate a Heterogeneous Agents New Keynesian (HANK) model in terms of its aggregate response to a monetary policy shock? In this paper, I show that the answer depends on the source of nominal rigidities. If prices are sticky, the answer is yes, as shown by Debortoli and Gali (2018). If wages are sticky, the answer is no, as shown in this paper. To make this point, I show that the TANK model with only wage rigidities is equivalent, in terms of aggregate variables, to the representative agent New Keynesian model. For TANK with both price and wage rigidities, I show numerically that TANK does not approximate HANK well.  </p>
